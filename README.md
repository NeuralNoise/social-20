# social
My attempts at a social network in PHP.

## Setup Instructions
- Preferrably create a separate MySQL database 
- Give required information for MySQL in config.php at root dir
- Edit the SQL query in database.php under the table settings. Change siteurl, baseurl, upload_url and sitename
- Run the SQL query under the database to be used for the app.
